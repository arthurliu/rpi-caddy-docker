Yet Another Dockerized Caddy HTTP/2 web server. Put the caddy in a docker container and ship it anywhere.

## Available tags

- `latest`, `0.10.2`: Caddy v0.10.2

## Features

- built on top of the solid and small `resin/rpi-raspbian:jessie` base image
- exposes Caddy on ports `80` and `443` and Caddy's default `2015` of the container
- runs everything as user `caddy` (security ftw!)

## Run 0.10.2/ latest

Available on the docker registry as [matthiasg/rpi-caddy:latest](https://index.docker.io/u/matthiasg/rpi-caddy/).

This is a build of the Caddy v0.10.2 release.

A data volume is exposed on /opt/caddy/data, and the node's ports are exposed on `80` and `443`.

```
# expose it to the world on ports 80 and 443 and use your current directory as the Caddy data directory
[sudo] docker run -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -v $(pwd):/var/lib/caddy matthiasg/rpi-caddy
[...]
```
